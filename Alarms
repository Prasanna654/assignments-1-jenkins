You work for XYZ Corporation. To maintain the security of the AWS account and
the resources you have been asked to implement a solution that can help easily
recognize and monitor the different users. Also, you will be monitoring the
machines created by these users for any errors or misconfigurations.
Tasks To Be Performed:
1. Create a dashboard which lets you check the CPU utilization and
networking for a particular EC2 instance

To implement a solution that helps recognize and monitor different users in your AWS account and monitor their EC2 instances (especially for CPU utilization and networking), here's a high-level and then step-by-step guide for Task 1: Creating a dashboard to check the CPU utilization and networking for a particular EC2 instance.

✅ Solution Overview
You can use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor EC2 instances, and create a CloudWatch Dashboard to visualize metrics like CPU utilization and network activity.

🔧 Steps to Create a CloudWatch Dashboard for EC2 Monitoring
Step 1: Enable Detailed Monitoring (Optional but Recommended)
By default, EC2 instances send metric data to CloudWatch at 5-minute intervals. You can enable detailed monitoring (1-minute intervals) for more granular data.

Go to EC2 Console > Instances.

Select the instance.

Click Actions > Monitor and troubleshoot > Enable detailed monitoring.

Step 2: Identify Key Metrics
For each EC2 instance, CloudWatch provides the following metrics:

CPUUtilization – % of CPU usage.

NetworkIn – Incoming traffic in bytes.

NetworkOut – Outgoing traffic in bytes.

Step 3: Create the CloudWatch Dashboard
Go to the CloudWatch Console.

In the left sidebar, click Dashboards > Create dashboard.

Name the dashboard (e.g., EC2-Monitoring-Dashboard).

Choose Line or Number widget (recommended for CPU and network metrics).

Click Configure.

Step 4: Add EC2 Metrics to the Dashboard
In the metrics selection panel:

Choose EC2 > Per-Instance Metrics.

Select your EC2 instance by instance ID.

Choose:

CPUUtilization

NetworkIn

NetworkOut

Adjust the graph or number widget display options (e.g., time range, period).

Click Add to dashboard.

Repeat to add multiple widgets for different metrics if needed.

Step 5: Save and Share Dashboard
Click Save dashboard.

Optionally, set IAM policies to control who can view/edit the dashboard.

✅ Optional Enhancements
Tag EC2 Instances by Owner/User: Add tags like Owner=JohnDoe to track instance ownership.

Use AWS CloudTrail + Config to monitor configuration changes.

Create Alarms: Set CloudWatch alarms for thresholds like CPU > 80% or NetworkOut drops to 0.

Would you like a CloudFormation template or Terraform code to automate this dashboard creation?

Sure! Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how to create a CloudWatch dashboard that monitors CPU utilization and networking (NetworkIn/Out) for a specific EC2 instance in your AWS account.

🧭 Step-by-Step Guide to Create a Monitoring Dashboard
🟩 Step 1: Log in to AWS Console
Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/

Log in with your IAM user credentials or root user (if allowed).

🟩 Step 2: Enable Detailed Monitoring for Your EC2 Instance (Optional but Recommended)
This helps get more frequent data (1-minute intervals instead of 5).

Open the EC2 Dashboard:
Go to Services > EC2 > Instances.

Select the EC2 instance you want to monitor.

Click Actions > Monitor and troubleshoot > Enable detailed monitoring.

Confirm the changes.

📌 This may add a small cost but gives more accurate data.

🟩 Step 3: Go to CloudWatch Dashboard
From the AWS Management Console, go to:
Services > CloudWatch.

In the left-hand menu, click Dashboards.

Click the “Create dashboard” button.

🟩 Step 4: Name the Dashboard
Enter a name, for example: EC2-Monitoring-Dashboard.

Click Create dashboard.

🟩 Step 5: Add a Widget
Choose “Line” or “Number” (line graphs are good for trends; number widgets are good for current values).

Click Next.

🟩 Step 6: Add CPU Utilization Metric
In the metrics search, click “Browse”.

Choose:

EC2 > Per-Instance Metrics

Find your instance using its Instance ID (you can also search by tags).

Select the checkbox for CPUUtilization.

Click “Create widget”.

🟩 Step 7: Add NetworkIn and NetworkOut Metrics
Repeat similar steps to add two more widgets:

Go back to the dashboard.

Click “Add widget” again.

Select Line or Number.

Choose:

NetworkIn for incoming traffic.

NetworkOut for outgoing traffic.

Click Create widget after selecting each metric.

🟩 Step 8: Arrange and Save Dashboard
Drag and resize widgets if needed.

Once satisfied, click Save dashboard in the top-right corner.

🟩 Step 9: (Optional) Set Permissions
If others in your team need access:

Use IAM policies to grant CloudWatch ReadOnly access to the dashboard.

Or share a read-only link using AWS IAM roles or AWS SSO.

🎯 Example Metrics to Include
Metric Name	Description	Widget Type
CPUUtilization	Shows how busy the instance CPU is	Line/Number
NetworkIn	Incoming network traffic (bytes)	Line/Number
NetworkOut	Outgoing network traffic (bytes)	Line/Number

Tasks To Be Performed:
1. Create a CloudWatch billing alarm which goes off when the estimated
charges go above $500.
2. Create a CloudWatch alarm which goes off to an Alarm state when the
CPU utilization of an EC2 instance goes above 65%. Also add an SNS
topic so that it notifies the person when the threshold is crossed

Here's a step-by-step guide to complete both tasks you've been assigned at XYZ Corporation to enhance AWS security and monitoring:

✅ Task 1: Create a CloudWatch Billing Alarm for Charges Over $500
📌 Prerequisites
Make sure billing alerts are enabled.

You must be in the N. Virginia (us-east-1) region (Billing metrics are only available here).

🔹 Step 1: Enable Billing Metrics
Go to Billing Dashboard:
AWS Console > Billing > Billing Preferences

Enable the option: Receive Billing Alerts.

Click Save Preferences.

🔹 Step 2: Create a Billing Alarm
Go to CloudWatch Console.

In the left menu, choose Alarms > All alarms > Create alarm.

Click Select metric > Choose:

Billing > Total Estimated Charge > USD

Click Select metric.

🔹 Step 3: Set Threshold
Statistic: Maximum

Period: 6 hours or 1 day

Threshold type: Static

Whenever metric is... Greater than 500

Click Next.

🔹 Step 4: Create or Select SNS Topic for Notification
Choose Create new topic:

Name: BillingAlarmTopic

Enter email address(es) to notify

Click Create topic.

Check your email and confirm the subscription.

🔹 Step 5: Finish Alarm Setup
Name your alarm: HighBillingAlarm-$500

Review and click Create alarm.

✅ Done! Now you'll get notified if charges exceed $500.

✅ Task 2: Create EC2 CPU Alarm + SNS Notification
This alarm will trigger if CPU Utilization > 65%.

🔹 Step 1: Open CloudWatch Alarms
Go to CloudWatch Console > Alarms > All alarms > Create alarm

🔹 Step 2: Select EC2 CPU Metric
