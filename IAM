You work for XYZ Corporation. To maintain the security of the AWS account and
the resources you have been asked to implement a solution that can help easily
recognize and monitor the different users.
Tasks To Be Performed:
1. Create 4 IAM users named “Dev1”, “Dev2”, “Test1”, and “Test2”.
2. Create 2 groups named “Dev Team” and “Ops Team”.
3. Add Dev1 and Dev2 to the Dev Team.
4. Add Dev1, Test1 and Test2 to the Ops Team

Here’s a simple and clear step-by-step guide to perform the required IAM (Identity and Access Management) setup for XYZ Corporation in AWS:

🎯 Goal
Create IAM users and groups to manage and monitor access to AWS resources securely.

✅ TASKS TO BE PERFORMED
🔹 Task 1: Create 4 IAM Users
Steps:
Go to AWS Management Console

Navigate to IAM → Users → Click “Add Users”

Add the following users (one by one or in bulk):

Dev1

Dev2

Test1

Test2

Access type: Select “Programmatic access” and/or “AWS Management Console access” as needed

Set password (for console access) or generate access key (for CLI/API)

Click Next, and skip permissions for now (you’ll add users to groups later)

Finish the wizard

✅ IAM Users Created

🔹 Task 2: Create 2 IAM Groups
Steps:
Go to IAM → User groups → Click “Create group”

Create the following groups:

Dev Team

Ops Team

You can skip attaching permissions for now (add them later if needed)

✅ Groups Created

🔹 Task 3: Add Dev1 and Dev2 to the Dev Team
Steps:
Go to IAM → Users

Select Dev1 → Click “Add user to groups” → Select “Dev Team” → Save

Repeat for Dev2

✅ Dev1 and Dev2 added to Dev Team

🔹 Task 4: Add Dev1, Test1, and Test2 to the Ops Team
Steps:
Repeat the same process:

Add Dev1, Test1, and Test2 to the Ops Team group

✅ Dev1, Test1, Test2 added to Ops Team

🔐 Optional: Attach Permissions to Groups
To apply access policies:

Go to IAM → User Groups

Select a group (e.g. Dev Team)

Click “Add permissions”

Choose:

AWS Managed Policies (like AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess, etc.)

Or create custom policies

📝 Summary Table
User	Groups
Dev1	Dev Team, Ops Team
Dev2	Dev Team
Test1	Ops Team
Test2	Ops Team

📝 Manual Process Summary (No Code Steps)
🔹 Step 1: IAM → Users → "Add users"
Create Dev1, Dev2, Test1, Test2

🔹 Step 2: IAM → User Groups → "Create group"
Create:

Dev Team

Ops Team

🔹 Step 3: IAM → Users → Select user → "Add to group"
Assign users:

Dev1, Dev2 → Dev Team

Dev1, Test1, Test2 → Ops Team

🔹 Step 4: IAM → Policies → "Create policy"
Paste the JSON (Policy #1 and #2) → Name them → Save

🔹 Step 5: IAM → User Groups → Select group → "Add permissions"
Attach Policy #1 to Dev Team

Attach Policy #2 to Ops Team

🔐 Optional: Monitor Access (Still Without Code)
You can also manually:

View who did what with CloudTrail

Analyze who has access to what using IAM Access Analyzer

✅ Conclusion:
You do not need to write any code to complete these tasks. The AWS Console provides user-friendly interfaces to do everything with clicks.
