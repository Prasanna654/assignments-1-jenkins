You work for XYZ Corporation. To maintain the security of the AWS account and
the resources you have been asked to implement a solution that can help easily
recognize and monitor the different users. Also, you will be monitoring the
machines created by these users for any errors or misconfigurations.
Tasks To Be Performed:
1. Create a dashboard which lets you check the CPU utilization and
networking for a particular EC2 instance

Got it! To create a dashboard in AWS that lets you monitor CPU utilization and networking for a specific EC2 instance, here’s a simple manual step-by-step guide you can follow using the AWS Management Console — no coding needed.

Task: Create a CloudWatch Dashboard to Monitor CPU & Networking of an EC2 Instance
Step 1: Identify the EC2 Instance
Log in to AWS Console.

Go to EC2 > Instances.

Note the Instance ID of the EC2 instance you want to monitor.

Step 2: Open CloudWatch Dashboard
In AWS Console, search for and open CloudWatch.

On the left sidebar, click Dashboards.

Click Create dashboard.

Give your dashboard a name (e.g., EC2-Monitor-Dashboard) and click Create dashboard.

Step 3: Add Widgets to Dashboard
You’ll add widgets for CPU Utilization and Network metrics.

Add CPU Utilization Widget
Choose Line widget and click Next.

In Metrics, select:

Namespace: EC2

Metric Name: CPUUtilization

Dimension: Select your EC2 InstanceId

Click Create widget.

Add Network Metrics Widget
Click Add widget → Choose Line widget → Next.

In Metrics, select:

Namespace: EC2

Metric Name: NetworkIn (for inbound traffic)

Dimension: Select the same InstanceId.

Click Add metric again.

Select NetworkOut (for outbound traffic), same InstanceId.

Click Create widget.

Step 4: View & Customize Dashboard
Your dashboard now shows:

CPU utilization graph.

Network input and output graphs.

You can resize or move widgets as needed.

The dashboard updates automatically with the latest data.

Optional: Set Alarms for Alerts
You can also create CloudWatch Alarms on these metrics to get notified if CPU usage spikes or network traffic is abnormal.

machines created by these users for any errors or misconfigurations.
Tasks To Be Performed:
1. Create a CloudWatch billing alarm which goes off when the estimated
charges go above $500.
2. Create a CloudWatch alarm which goes off to an Alarm state when the
CPU utilization of an EC2 instance goes above 65%. Also add an SNS
topic so that it notifies the person when the threshold is crossed.

Sure! Here's a simple manual step-by-step guide to complete the tasks using the AWS Console—no coding required.

Tasks:
Create a CloudWatch Billing Alarm for estimated charges > $500

Create a CloudWatch CPU Utilization Alarm for an EC2 instance > 65% with SNS notification

Task 1: Create a CloudWatch Billing Alarm (Estimated Charges > $500)
Steps:
Login to AWS Console.

Open CloudWatch service.

In the left sidebar, click Alarms → All alarms → Create alarm.

Click Select metric.

Under Browse, choose Billing → EstimatedCharges.

For Currency, select your currency (usually USD).

Click on Total EstimatedCharge metric.

Click Select metric.

Configure the alarm:

Period: 6 hours (default)

Threshold type: Static

Whenever EstimatedCharges is...: Greater than 500

Click Next.

Configure notifications:

Choose Create new topic or select an existing SNS topic.

Enter email addresses to receive the notification.

Confirm subscription in your email inbox (you’ll get an email to confirm).

Add a name for the alarm, e.g., Billing-Alarm-Over-500.

Review and Create alarm.

Task 2: Create a CloudWatch Alarm for EC2 CPU Utilization > 65% with SNS Notification
Steps:
In CloudWatch, go to Alarms → All alarms → Create alarm.

Click Select metric.

Browse to EC2 → Per-Instance Metrics → Select the instance by InstanceId.

Select CPUUtilization metric and click Select metric.

Configure the alarm:

Period: 5 minutes (recommended)

Threshold type: Static

Whenever CPUUtilization is Greater than 65%.

Click Next.

Notifications:

Choose an existing SNS topic or create a new one.

Enter email addresses to notify.

Confirm subscription via email.

Name the alarm, e.g., EC2-CPU-Utilization-High.

Review and Create alarm.
