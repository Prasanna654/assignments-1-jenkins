You work for XYZ Corporation and based on the expansion requirements of your
corporation you have been asked to create and set up a distinct Amazon VPC for
the production and development team. You are expected to perform the following
tasks for the respective VPCs.
Production Network:
1. Design and build a 4-tier architecture.
2. Create 5 subnets out of which 4 should be private named app1, app2,
dbcache and db and one should be public, named web.
3. Launch instances in all subnets and name them as per the subnet that
they have been launched in.
4. Allow dbcache instance and app1 subnet to send internet requests.
5. Manage security groups and NACLs.
Development Network:
1. Design and build 2-tier architecture with two subnets named web and db
and launch instances in both subnets and name them as per the subnet
names.
2. Make sure only the web subnet can send internet requests.
3. Create peering connection between production network and development
network.
4. Setup connection between db subnets of both production network and
development network respectively.

Setting up the requested architecture involves detailed AWS VPC planning and implementation. Below is a step-by-step guide to accomplish the tasks for XYZ Corporation using Amazon VPC, covering Production and Development environments.

🌐 Part 1: VPC Design Overview
🏭 Production VPC
Name: Production-VPC

CIDR Block: 10.0.0.0/16

Subnets (Total 5):

web (Public) – 10.0.0.0/24

app1 (Private) – 10.0.1.0/24

app2 (Private) – 10.0.2.0/24

dbcache (Private) – 10.0.3.0/24

db (Private) – 10.0.4.0/24

🧪 Development VPC
Name: Development-VPC

CIDR Block: 10.1.0.0/16

Subnets (Total 2):

web (Public) – 10.1.0.0/24

db (Private) – 10.1.1.0/24

✅ Step-by-Step Implementation
🚧 Step 1: Create VPCs
Production VPC

Create VPC Production-VPC with 10.0.0.0/16.

Development VPC

Create VPC Development-VPC with 10.1.0.0/16.

🗂 Step 2: Create Subnets
In Production-VPC:
Subnet	CIDR	Type	Availability Zone	Name Tag
web	10.0.0.0/24	Public	any	Production-web
app1	10.0.1.0/24	Private	any	Production-app1
app2	10.0.2.0/24	Private	any	Production-app2
dbcache	10.0.3.0/24	Private	any	Production-dbcache
db	10.0.4.0/24	Private	any	Production-db

In Development-VPC:
Subnet	CIDR	Type	Availability Zone	Name Tag
web	10.1.0.0/24	Public	any	Development-web
db	10.1.1.0/24	Private	any	Development-db

🌐 Step 3: Create Internet Gateway and Attach to VPC
Create an Internet Gateway (IGW) and attach it to both VPCs.

Update route table for public subnets (e.g., web) to allow 0.0.0.0/0 via IGW.

🔁 Step 4: NAT Gateway for Private Subnet Internet Access
Create an Elastic IP (EIP).

Launch NAT Gateway in the public subnet (web of Production).

Update route table of:

Production-app1 and Production-dbcache subnets to route 0.0.0.0/0 to the NAT Gateway.

🛑 Do not add NAT routes for app2 or db — they should stay private.

💻 Step 5: Launch EC2 Instances
Launch EC2 Instances in each subnet (using appropriate AMIs):

Production:
Instance in web named web

Instance in app1 named app1

Instance in app2 named app2

Instance in dbcache named dbcache

Instance in db named db

Development:
Instance in web named web

Instance in db named db

Use Name tags for easy identification.

🔐 Step 6: Configure Security Groups
Web Instances: Allow inbound HTTP (80), SSH (22) from anywhere.

App Instances: Allow inbound from web and between app1/app2.

DBCache & DB: Allow only from app1 and app2.

Allow outbound traffic where required.

🔁 Ensure dbcache and app1 instances can access internet → done via NAT Gateway + SG.

🧱 Step 7: Configure Network ACLs (NACLs)
Keep default NACLs or tighten as needed:

Public subnet (web): allow all inbound/outbound HTTP, HTTPS, SSH.

Private subnets: restrict unnecessary external access.

🔗 Step 8: VPC Peering Setup
Create VPC Peering Connection between Production-VPC and Development-VPC.

Accept the connection from the target VPC.

Update route tables in both VPCs to route respective CIDR blocks to the peer connection.

Example:

In Production-VPC route table: add 10.1.0.0/16 via peering

In Development-VPC route table: add 10.0.0.0/16 via peering

📡 Step 9: DB-to-DB Communication Setup
Allow communication only between Production-db and Development-db:

In SG for Production-db: allow traffic from Development-db IP/Security Group.

In SG for Development-db: allow traffic from Production-db IP/Security Group.

Ensure route table has correct peering route.

✅ Final Checklist
Task	Status
VPCs Created	✅
Subnets Created	✅
Instances Launched	✅
Internet Access Configured (IGW, NAT)	✅
Security Groups & NACLs	✅
VPC Peering Configured	✅
DB-to-DB Subnet Communication	✅

Absolutely! Here's a simple, step-by-step explanation of how to set up the Production and Development VPCs for XYZ Corporation on AWS:

🌟 Production Network Setup (4-Tier Architecture)
🔧 Step 1: Create Production VPC
Go to VPC Console → Create VPC

Name: Production-VPC

CIDR Block: 10.0.0.0/16

🗂 Step 2: Create 5 Subnets
Create 5 subnets under Production-VPC:

Subnet Name	CIDR	Type
web	10.0.0.0/24	Public
app1	10.0.1.0/24	Private
app2	10.0.2.0/24	Private
dbcache	10.0.3.0/24	Private
db	10.0.4.0/24	Private

🌐 Step 3: Add Internet Access
Create Internet Gateway (IGW) → Attach to Production-VPC

Create NAT Gateway:

First, create Elastic IP

Then create NAT Gateway in web subnet

Routing:

Public subnet (web): route internet (0.0.0.0/0) → IGW

app1 and dbcache: route internet (0.0.0.0/0) → NAT Gateway

app2 and db: no internet route

💻 Step 4: Launch EC2 Instances
Launch one EC2 instance in each subnet:

Name them: web, app1, app2, dbcache, db

🔐 Step 5: Set Security Groups & NACLs
Allow:

Internet traffic (HTTP, SSH) to web

app1 & dbcache to access internet (via NAT)

Only allow internal communication to db, dbcache, and app2

🧪 Development Network Setup (2-Tier Architecture)
🔧 Step 1: Create Development VPC
VPC Name: Development-VPC

CIDR: 10.1.0.0/16

🗂 Step 2: Create 2 Subnets
Subnet Name	CIDR	Type
web	10.1.0.0/24	Public
db	10.1.1.0/24	Private

🌐 Step 3: Internet Access
Create Internet Gateway (IGW) and attach to Development-VPC

web subnet route → IGW (for internet)

db subnet has no internet access

💻 Step 4: Launch EC2 Instances
Launch EC2 instances in web and db subnets

Name them: web, db

🔗 Connect Production and Development
🔁 Step 1: Create VPC Peering
In VPC → Peering Connections → Create:

Source: Production-VPC

Target: Development-VPC

Accept the connection in Development

Add route in both VPCs to reach each other

🔌 Step 2: Connect db Subnets
In Production-db security group:

Allow access from Development-db

In Development-db security group:

Allow access from Production-db

Ensure peering routes are correct

✅ Done!
You now have:

A 4-tier Production network with controlled internet access

A 2-tier Development network

Peering between VPCs

DB-to-DB communication between networks

Great! Let's break down Step 4 and Step 5 into easy-to-follow instructions on how to launch EC2 instances and configure Security Groups & NACLs.

✅ Step 4: Launch EC2 Instances in Each Subnet
You’ll repeat these steps for each of the 5 subnets in the Production VPC:

🔧 Steps to Launch an EC2 Instance:
Go to the EC2 Console → click “Launch Instance”

Fill in the following details:

Name: (e.g., web, app1, app2, dbcache, or db)

AMI: Choose Amazon Linux 2 or any OS you prefer

Instance type: e.g., t2.micro (Free Tier eligible)

Key Pair: Select or create one to SSH into the instance

Network Settings:

VPC: Choose Production-VPC

Subnet: Choose the correct subnet (web, app1, etc.)

Auto-assign Public IP:

✅ Yes for web (public subnet)

❌ No for app1, app2, dbcache, db (private subnets)

Security Group: You can create a new one or assign existing ones

Click “Launch Instance”

📝 Do this 5 times, once for each subnet. Name each instance according to the subnet.

✅ Step 5: Configure Security Groups & NACLs
Security Groups act like firewalls for instances. NACLs act like firewalls for subnets.

🔐 A. Create Security Groups
You can create separate Security Groups or use a few shared ones. Here's how:

1. Web Server SG (for instance in web subnet):
Inbound Rules:

SSH (port 22) from your IP (x.x.x.x/32)

HTTP (port 80) from 0.0.0.0/0 (everyone)

Outbound Rules: Allow All

2. App SG (for app1, app2):
Inbound:

From web SG on necessary app ports (e.g., TCP 3000, 8080)

From other app servers as needed

Outbound:

Allow internet via NAT

3. dbcache SG (for dbcache):
Inbound:

Allow from app1 only (SG or IP range)

Outbound:

Allow internet via NAT

4. db SG (for db):
Inbound:

Allow from app1 and app2 only (via their SGs)

Outbound:

No internet needed (can leave default or restrict)

🧱 B. Configure NACLs (Optional if SGs are strict)
You can keep the default NACLs (they allow all in/out), or tighten them:

Example NACL for Public Subnet (web):
Inbound:

Allow 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP) from 0.0.0.0/0

Outbound:

Allow all

Example NACL for Private Subnets (e.g., app1, db):
Inbound:

Allow only from known ports and IP ranges (e.g., web subnet, app1)

Outbound:

Allow only NAT or internal VPC traffic

🔁 Internet Access Recap
Subnet	Public IP	Internet Route	Notes
web	Yes	IGW	Direct internet access
app1	No	NAT Gateway	Indirect access via NAT
dbcache	No	NAT Gateway	Indirect access via NAT
app2	No	No	Internal only
db	No	No	Internal only
